# Deep Learning 2023 Project - CLIP for Visual Grounding

This repository contains the implementation of a visual grounding pipeline developed as part of the Deep Learning course project at the University of Trento (2023). The project explores adapting CLIP, a vision-language pre-trained model, for the task of visual grounding using the RefCOCOg dataset.
